Implement a secure purchase order system that allows the user to enter a purchase request and
routes it to Order Processing Department (OPD) for signature. Each customer has an account
with the online purchasing system. The online purchasing system has the public-key of every
customer.

First, the customer enters his/her ID and password. The system verifies his/her ID and pass-
word. Next, the customer sends the order as well as a timestamp to the OPD - confidentiality
and digital signature must be provided. OPD verifies the signature of the customer and checks
if the product is available. If the customerâ€™s signature is verified and the product is available,
OPD prepares the order. After OPD processes the order, OPD retrieves the customers email
address and sends an email to the customer, indicating that the order has been shipped. OPD
should be implemented as a concurrent server.
Your implementation must provide both confidentiality and digital signature. For digital sig-
nature you must provide the user with a choice of using RSA or Digital Signature Algorithm
(DSA;
https://bit.ly/2TvvGSt).
Both digital signature schemes must be supported


Current Goal:
-check if order bytes match

Side Quests(Optional):
- Store the hashes and salts of the passwords in the database, not the actual passwords
- Use a HTTPS connection rather than HTTPS
